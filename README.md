# ABC Supermarket Marketing Campaign for Organic Products

## Project Goal

ABC Supermarket aims to achieve rapid market penetration for their new line of organic products through an analytics-enabled marketing campaign targeted at their loyalty program participants. The primary objectives are:

- **Optimize Profitability:** Develop a strategy to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with the marketing campaign.
- **Maximize Market Penetration:** Increase the adoption rate of the new organic products among the loyalty program participants.

## Approach

1. **Data Analysis and Segmentation:**
   - Analyze demographic information and loyalty program details of participants who received free sample kits.
   - Segment participants based on factors such as age, gender, location, and loyalty program engagement.

2. **Target Audience Identification:**
   - Identify potential buyers among the 90% of participants who have not received sample kits based on the analysis of the 10% sample data.

3. **Marketing Strategy Development:**
   - Develop a targeted marketing strategy to focus resources on the most probable buyers identified through data analysis.
   - Allocate promotional efforts effectively to maximize return on investment (ROI).

4. **Financial Considerations:**
   - Calculate the expected revenue from successful buyers, considering each buyer generates £146.1 in revenue.
   - Factor in the cost of £43.05 per promotional sample kit to optimize campaign profitability.

### Steps and Findings

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Cleaned the loyalty program data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
   - Prepared the data for analysis by organizing it into relevant categories (demographics, loyalty details).

   - Created pivot tables to summarize and visualize key metrics such as:
     - Total number of participants
     - Distribution of participants by age, gender, and location
     - Loyalty program engagement levels
     - Initial response rate from the 10% sample group

3. **Charts and Visualizations:**
   - Developed charts to illustrate trends and patterns in participant demographics and engagement.
   - Visualized purchase decision rates among participants who received sample kits to identify potential buyer segments.

4. **Future Steps:**
   - Implement predictive modeling techniques to forecast purchase behavior among the remaining 90% of participants.
   - Refine the marketing strategy based on predictive insights to target the most promising buyer segments effectively.
