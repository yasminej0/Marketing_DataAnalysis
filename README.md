# ABC Supermarket Marketing Campaign for Organic Products

## Project Goal

ABC Supermarket aims to achieve rapid market penetration for their new line of organic products through an analytics-enabled marketing campaign targeted at their loyalty program participants. The primary objectives are:

- **Optimize Profitability:** Develop a strategy to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with the marketing campaign.
- **Maximize Market Penetration:** Increase the adoption rate of the new organic products among the loyalty program participants.

## Approach

1. **Data Analysis and Segmentation:**
   - Analyze demographic information and loyalty program details of participants who received free sample kits.
   - Segment participants based on factors such as age, gender, location, and loyalty program engagement.

2. **Target Audience Identification:**
   - Identify potential buyers among the 90% of participants who have not received sample kits based on the analysis of the 10% sample data.

3. **Marketing Strategy Development:**
   - Develop a targeted marketing strategy to focus resources on the most probable buyers identified through data analysis.
   - Allocate promotional efforts effectively to maximize return on investment (ROI).

4. **Financial Considerations:**
   - Calculate the expected revenue from successful buyers, considering each buyer generates £146.1 in revenue.
   - Factor in the cost of £43.05 per promotional sample kit to optimize campaign profitability.
